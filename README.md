Work done in class

Hi, I'm Elias and I am majoring in Computer Science and Suny New Paltz.
I'm originally from Athens Greece but moved to New York 8 years ago and stayed ever since 
I attended Suny New Paltz freshman year and have been here ever since. My programming experience started freshman year, had no programming knowledge before then.
Some projects I have worked one was a course management system for my software engineering course, interpreter and compiler for Language processing, maze generator and solver, and currently working on a chess website on my spare time.

I see myself using the skills and techinques taught in this course for post graduation life. We are learning various technologies throughout this 13 week cours, which of course I do not expect to master or learn the intricate details of each technology. But, using the methodology of solving and approaching problems and using various technologies to understand the intricacies that makes them different but similar. I am excited to work on two mobile-first web apps during the semester.
